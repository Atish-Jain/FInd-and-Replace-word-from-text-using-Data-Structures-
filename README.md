# Find-and-Replace-word-from-text-using-Data-Structures-
A find and replace functionality available in different word processors was implemented using Binary Search Tree and Singly Linked List in C Language. BST is used to find the word whereas Linked List is used to replace the word and to rewrite the text in a file in same order. 
# Process:
* Firstly a file was read.
* Each word is added in BST and Linked List.
1. For Find Operation:
* Enter word that has to be find.
* Program will traverse the BST and count the occurence of desired word.
2. For Replace Operation: 
* Enter the word that has to be replaced then enter new word.
* Program will search the old word in Linked List and replaces it with new word.
* It will simultaneously update the BST also.
* Finally the new text was rewritten the file.
